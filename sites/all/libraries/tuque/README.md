# Tuque [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Islandora/tuque.png?branch=1.x)](https://travis-ci.org/Islandora/tuque)

## Introduction

This is the [API](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora/wiki/Working-With-Fedora-Objects-Programmatically-Via-Tuque) that Islandora uses to communicate with Fedora Commons.

## Requirements

* PHP 5.3+

## Installation

Tuque is expected to be in one of two paths:

 * sites/all/libraries/tuque (libraries directory may need to be created)
 * islandora_folder/libraries/tuque

## Configuration

There is a configuration option that if set in the ini will override the control group of the RELS-EXT and RELS-INT datastreams. We default these control groups to X if the setting is not present.
Setting this to M can increase the stability and performance of Fedora.

```
[Tuque]
tuque.rels_ds_control_group = M
```

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

There are [issues](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/FCREPO-849) that are inconsistent across Fedora versions and not fully explored with making the relation datastreams managed.

Tests with the Islandora UI and Fedora 3.6.2 have not shown issues.
