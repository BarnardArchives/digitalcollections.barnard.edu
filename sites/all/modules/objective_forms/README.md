# Objective Forms [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Islandora/objective_forms.png?branch=7.x)](https://travis-ci.org/Islandora/objective_forms)

## Introduction

The Objective Forms module contains a series of functions and classes that allow Drupal forms to be treated as PHP objects. It provides back-end support to XML Forms so that Drupal's built-in form functions and classes can be used when filling out metadata.

Some important notes:

* Each form element is assigned a unique hash Form Property to identify it, as #hash.
* Each form element that is created is stored in a registry, and it will persist though out the lifetime of the form even if it's removed from the form. Ancestry of Form Elements is stored, so if a Form Element is cloned we will be able to determine the Form Element that is was cloned from.
* Form Properties can be objects. To define new Form Properties, implement the hook `objectify_properties`.
* Forms will be auto-populated from `$form_state['values']`.
* There is a FormStorage class that can be used to store any persistent data.
