# PHP Lib [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Islandora/php_lib.png?branch=7.x)](https://travis-ci.org/Islandora/php_lib)

## Introduction

PHP Lib is a collection (or 'library') of interfaces, classes and functions that are required by a variety of Islandora modules, most notably the Forms modules. It is used primarily to create pages that convert records in XML formats to a more human-readable version that is also able to be easily manipulated. This is done by a series of PHP files that Drupal includes when loading these pages.
