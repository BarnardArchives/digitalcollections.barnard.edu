# barnard_islandora_exhibit

This module provides custom functionality for the [Digital Exhibits](http://digitalcollections.barnard.edu/exhibits) section of Barnard's Digital Collections. It relies on two custom content types, _exhibition_ and _exhibition_object_, and on a custom view, all of which can be created using _bc_islandora_exhibit_feature_ and [Features](https://www.drupal.org/project/features). It also relies on [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) to generate CSS.
