SUMMARY
-------
This module provides a number of REST end points for fetching/manipulating
objects, datastreams, and object relationships from islandora.

The basic structure of the module is such that we define Drupal Menu’s for each
resource type. Currently the resources are __objects__, __datastreams__,
__relationships__, and __solr__. Each Menu defines a callback that generates the
HTTP responses for any HTTP Methods requested of the given resource
__GET__, __PUT__, __POST__, __DELETE__.

This callback will load a file dedicated to the particular resource located in
includes folder and call a function associated with the HTTP method.

So for example if I make a __GET__ request for an __object__, it will auto load
the includes/object.inc file and call a function mapped to the GET method:

```PHP
function islandora_rest_object_get_response(array $parameters) { ... }
```

If it were a __PUT__ request for an __object__ it would be:

```PHP
function islandora_rest_object_put_response(array $parameters) { ... }
```

These functions are responsible for performing any required actions, say
purge an object, etc. As well as generating a response for the client
which will typically be a JSON response.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

  * [Islandora](http://github.com/islandora/islandora)
  * [Islandora SOLR Search](http://github.com/islandora/islandora_solr_search) (Optional)

INSTALLATION
------------

Assumes the following global XACML polices have been removed from:

$FEDORA_HOME/data/fedora-xacml-policies/repository-policies/default

* deny-inactive-or-deleted-objects-or-datastreams-if-not-administrator.xml
* deny-policy-management-if-not-administrator.xml
* deny-purge-datastream-if-active-or-inactive.xml
* deny-purge-object-if-active-or-inactive.xml

This module will still function with those policies in place but the tests this
module defines will fail. Also when installing Islandora don't forget to deploy
the policies it includes!

[Islandora SOLR Search](http://github.com/islandora/islandora_solr_search) is an
optional dependancy that will allow you to perform SOLR searches via this REST
API. Follow the directions it provides if you wish to enable SOLR searches.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

For each of the REST end-points defined below in the documentation section there
exists a corresponding Drupal Permission (with the exception of SOLR which uses
the permissions defined by the Islandora SOLR Search module).


After enabling this module navigate to www.yoursite.com/admin/people/permissions
and enable the features you want to expose. Note that XACML is still enforced on
all REST end-points and access can still be denied regardless of what Drupal
Permissions are enabled.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

In an effort to simplify the __datastream__ REST end-point multi-part responses
for __GET__ requests were investigated. With the intention of returning both
the content and properties through a single request. While this is possible it
is not well supported by jQuery, there exists a
[plug-in](http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/mpAjax), I am unsure if this
plugin works with all browsers. To get around this issue __GET__ requests for a
__datastream__ can return either the content or properties but not both for the
moment.


Also since __PUT__ / __DELETE__ support is lacking in IE6-9, we've provided the
ability to mock __PUT__ / __DELETE__ requests as __POST__ requests by adding an
additional form-data field **method** to inform the server which method was
actually intended.


At the moment multi-part __PUT__ requests such as the one required to modify an
existing __datastream's__ content and properties are **not implemented** you
can mock these __PUT__ requests using aforementioned mechanism. __POST__ and
include an additional form-data field **method** with the value __PUT__.


Adding support for multi-part __PUT__ requests is possible but would require
writing or using and HTTP Request parsing library as __PUT__ is not well
supported in __PHP__.

Since we don't have an HTTP Request parsing library __PUT__ requests are
expecting raw **application/json** content as the request body.

### Authorization

In its most common use case - JavaScript executing AJAX callbacks inside module
code - no authorization is needed. For external requests, however, an additional
step is required.

Drupal doesn't support basic authorization out of the box; any script or other
such code that needs authentication to hit the various REST endpoints should
first make a POST request to the site login page and then maintain cookies for
future requests.

For example, using cURL on a UNIX-like system, and replacing `USERNAME`,
`PASSWORD`, and `SITE_URL` with those respective items:
```bash
curl --cookie-jar ./cookies.txt -X POST -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F "name=USERNAME" -F "pass=PASSWORD" -F "form_id=user_login" -F "op=Log in" "http://SITE_URL/user/login"
```

In this case:
* `name` and `pass` represent the login credentials
* `form_id` represents the machine name of the form being POSTed to
* `op` represents the element on the page being used to execute the POST

The stored session data in cookies.txt could then be used for future cURL
requests to the API.

Of course, a more comprehensive solution is almost certainly desirable so that
passwords are not stored in history - Bash or otherwise - but the same
principles apply.

### Documentation Key
{variable} Required Parameter.

[variable] Optional Parameter no default defined, NULL or empty string likely be
used.

[variable, ’default’] Optional Parameter and it’s default.

### Common Responses
Unless otherwise specified each end-point can return the following responses.

#### Response: 400 Bad Request
##### Content-Type: application/json
|Name   |Description                              |
|-------|-----------------------------------------|
|message|A message saying the request was invalid.|

400 errors will be triggered by invalid information being provided to a query.
In these cases, the request should not be repeated, but rather fixed before
another request is made.

#### Response: 401 Unauthorized
##### No response body.
In general 401 means an anonymous user attempted some action and was denied.
Either the action is not granted to anonymous uses in the Drupal permissions,
or XACML denied the action for the anonymous user.

#### Response: 403 Forbidden
##### No response body.
In general 403 means an authenticated user attempted some action and was denied.
Either the authenticated user does not have a Drupal role that grants him/her
permission to perform that action, or XACML denied the action for that user.

#### Response: 404 Not Found
##### No response body.
In general a 404 will occur, when a user tries to perform an action on a
object or datastream that doesn't not exist. Or XACML is hiding that
object or datastream from the user.

404 Responses can be returned even if the user was **not** determined to have
permission to perform the requested action, as the resource must be first
fetched from fedora before the users permission can be determined.

#### Response: 500 Internal Server Error
##### Content-Type: application/json
| Name          | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| message       | A detail description of the error.

Any problem can trigger a 500 error, but in general you'll find that this is
typically an error returned by Fedora.

## Search For Objects
This is a light wrapper for the SOLR own end point. It incorporates XACML alters
to restrict the search results for the given user. The Islandora Solr Search
'Search the Solr index' permission is used for authentication instead of any
custom permissions from this module.

Because parameters are passed through to Solr carte blanche, invalid requests
may trigger 400 errors. `Apache_Solr_Service` does not provide details about the
error in these cases, so a generic message is given.

#### URL syntax
islandora/rest/v1/solr/{query}

#### HTTP Method
GET

#### Headers
Accept: application/json

#### Get Variables
| Name          | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| query         | The SOLR query to execute.
| ...           | See the SOLR documentation for the additional parameters it can take.

#### Response: 200 OK
##### Content-Type: application/json
The result will be unmodified server side since all the query types support the
return of JSON directly to the user. So this will more or less just delegate to
those respective end points. See the documentation for SOLR for more info.

## Permission Mappings

### Islandora Core Permissions mapping
To ensure all object restrictions are respected on Islandora REST requests, core islandora permissions are mapped in
the following way:

#### Islandora Rest and Islandora Core permissions mapping
| Rest Permission Name                     | Islandora Core Permission                                    |

| ISLANDORA_REST_OBJECT_GET_PERM           | ISLANDORA_VIEW_OBJECTS
| ISLANDORA_REST_OBJECT_PUT_PERM           | ISLANDORA_MANAGE_PROPERTIES
| ISLANDORA_REST_OBJECT_POST_PERM          | ISLANDORA_INGEST
